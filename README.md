badge board
---

Fork from [https://github.com/repo-utils/badgeboard](https://github.com/repo-utils/badgeboard).

## Pulling from here:

```sh
~/your-org.github.io$ git pull https://github.com/repo-utils/badgeboard.git
~/your-org.github.io$ make ; make db
~/your-org.github.io$ git commit index.html src/db.json -m 'rebuild'
~/your-org.github.io$ git push
```

You'll probably need to resolve merge conflicts after you do `git pull`.

## Creating new badgeboard:

1\. clone this repo

```sh
~$ git clone https://github.com/repo-utils/badgeboard.git your-org.github.io
```

2\. change `config.yaml`

3\. change `.gitignore`, unignore autogenerated files, see comments there.
  Specifically, you want to uncomment `index.html` from the `.gitignore`.

4\. make it:

```sh
~/your-org.github.io$ make
```

5\. test it:

```sh
~/your-org.github.io$ firefox index.html
```

6\. add autogenerated files so they will appear on github pages:

```sh
~/your-org.github.io$ git add src/db.json index.html
~/your-org.github.io$ git commit src/db.json index.html -m 'rebuild'
```

## Deployment Methods

There are two ways to deploy the badge board.
The first is to deploy it at `https://<your-org>.github.io`.
To do so, simply push your badgeboard to `https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-org>.github.io`.

The second way is to deploy it to a URL like `https://<your-org>.github.io/badgeboard`.
You may prefer this method if you are already have a page for your GitHub organization.
To do so, push your badgeboard to `https://github.com/<your-org>/badgeboard`
and change the default branch to `gh-pages` instead of `master`.
Of course, you don't have to name the repository `badgeboard` - you can name it whatever you'd like.
